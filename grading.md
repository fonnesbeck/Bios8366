# Grading and Assignments

Students will be assessed on 3-4 assignments (50% of grade) and a final project (50% of grade). Additionally, there will be weekly readings of both the assigned textbook and/or relevant papers from the literature.

Assignments may be submitted as an IPython Notebook, LaTeX, Markdown or reStructuredText file (other formats by request). **Assignments submitted in word processor file formats, including Microsoft Word, will not be accepted**. Hand-written assignments (including scanned documents) are also not permitted.

All assignments will be submitted electronically, via students' private GitHub repositories. Instructions on how to set up and use GitHub accounts will be provided.
