(1989), which examined the correlation between the level of prostate-specific antigen (`lpsa`) and a number of clinical measures in men who were about to receive a radical prostatectomy. The variables are log cancer volume (`lcavol`), log prostate weight (`lweight`), age, log of the amount of benign prostatic hyperplasia (`lbph`), seminal vesicle invasion (`svi`), log of capsular penetration (`lcp`), Gleason score (`gleason`), and percent of Gleason scores 4 or 5 (`pgg45`). \n",

The so-called .632 estimator aleviates this bias by returning a weighted average of the training error (average loss over the training sample) and the leave-one-out (LOO) bootstrap error:\n",
