    "# Computational Methods in Bayesian Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of conducting Bayesian inference can be broken down into three general steps (Gelman *et al.* 2013):\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Specify a probability model\n",
    "\n",
    "As was noted above, Bayesian statistics involves using probability models to solve problems. So, the first task is to *completely specify* the model in terms of probability distributions. This includes everything: unknown parameters, data, covariates, missing data, predictions. All must be assigned some probability density.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves making choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- what is the form of the sampling distribution of the data?\n",
    "- what form best describes our uncertainty in the unknown parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate a posterior distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical form \\\\(p(\\theta | y)\\\\) that we associated with the Bayesian approach is referred to as a **posterior distribution**.\n",
    "\n",
    "> posterior /pos·ter·i·or/ (pos-tēr´e-er) later in time; subsequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why posterior? Because it tells us what we know about the unknown \\\\(\\theta\\\\) *after* having observed \\\\(y\\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "This posterior distribution is formulated as a function of the probability model that was specified in Step 1. Usually, we can write it down but we cannot calculate it analytically. In fact, the difficulty inherent in calculating the posterior distribution for most models of interest is perhaps the major contributing factor for the lack of widespread adoption of Bayesian methods for data analysis. Various strategies for doing so comprise this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But**, once the posterior distribution is calculated, you get a lot for free:\n",
    "\n",
    "- point estimates\n",
    "- credible intervals\n",
    "- quantiles\n",
    "- predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Check your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Though frequently ignored in practice, it is critical that the model and its outputs be assessed before using the outputs for inference. Models are specified based on assumptions that are largely unverifiable, so the least we can do is examine the output in detail, relative to the specified model and the data that were used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we must ask:\n",
    "\n",
    "- does the model fit data?\n",
    "- are the conclusions reasonable?\n",
    "- are the outputs sensitive to changes in model structure?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: binomial calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "Binomial model is suitable for data that are generated from a sequence of exchangeable Bernoulli trials. These data can be summarized by $y$, the number of times the event of interest occurs, and $n$, the total number of trials. The model parameter is the expected proportion of trials that an event occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\\[p(Y|\\theta) = \\frac{n!}{y! (n-y)!} \\theta^{y} (1-\\theta)^{n-y}\\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $p \\in [0, 1]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform Bayesian inference, we require the specification of a prior distribution. A reasonable choice is a uniform prior on [0,1] which has two implications:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. makes all probability values equally probable *a priori* \n",
    "2. makes calculation of the posterior easy\n",
    "\n",
    "The second task in performing Bayesian inference is, given a fully-specified model, to calculate a posterior distribution. As we have specified the model, we can calculate a posterior distribution up to a proportionality constant (that is, a probability distribution that is **unnormalized**):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta | n, y) \\propto P(y | n, \\theta) P(\\theta) = \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can present different posterior distributions as a function of different realized data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also calculate posterior estimates for $\\theta$ by maximizing the unnormalized posterior using optimization. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise: posterior estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that returns posterior estimates of a binomial sampling model using a uniform prior on the unknown probability. Plot the posterior densities for each of the following datasets:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. n=5, y=3\n",
    "2. n=20, y=12\n",
    "3. n=100, y=60\n",
    "4. n=1000, y=600\n",
    "\n",
    "what type of distribution do these plots look like?"

    "## Informative Priors\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we justify a non-informative prior by the **Principle of Insufficient Reason**, which states that uniform probability is justified when there is nothing known about the parameter in question. Frequently, it is inappropriate to employ an uninformative prior as we have done above. For some distributions there is no clear choice of such a prior, particularly when parameters are transformed. For example, a flat prior on the real line is not flat on the unit interval. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two alternative interpretations of the prior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Population prior**: a distribution that represents a notional population of values for the parameter, from which those in the current experiment/study have been drawn.\n",
    "2. **Knowledge prior**: a distribution that represents our uncertainty about the true value of the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, a prior distribution should include in its support all parameter values that are plausible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing an informative prior presents an analytic challenge with respect to the functional form of the prior distribution. We would like a prior that results in a posterior distribution that is simple to work with. Taking our binomial likelihood again as an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta | n, y) \\propto \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we can see that it is of the general form $\\theta^a (1-\\theta)^b$. Thus, we are looking for a parametric distribution that describes the distribution of or uncertainty in $\\theta$ that is of this general form. The **beta distribution** satisfies these criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta | \\alpha, \\beta) \\propto \\theta^{\\alpha-1} (1-\\theta)^{\\beta-1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters $\\alpha, \\beta$ are called **hyperparameters**, and here they suggest prior information corresponding to $\\alpha-1$ \"successes\" and $\\beta-1$ failures. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go ahead and calculate the posterior distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "P(\\theta | n, y) &\\propto& \\theta^y (1-\\theta)^{n-y} \\theta^{\\alpha-1} (1-\\theta)^{\\beta-1} \\\\\n",
    "    &=& \\theta^{y+\\alpha-1} (1-\\theta)^{n-y+\\beta-1} \\\\\n",
    "    &=& \\text{Beta}(\\alpha + y, \\beta + n -y) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this instance, the posterior distribution follows the same functional form as the prior. This phenomenon is referred to as **conjugacy**, whereby the beta distribution is in the conjugate family for the binomial sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is the posterior distribution when a Beta(1,1) prior is used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, we defined conjugacy by saying that a class $\\mathcal{P}$ is a conjugate prior for the class $\\mathcal{F}$ of likelihoods if:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P(\\theta | y) \\propto f(y|\\theta) p(\\theta) \\in \\mathcal{P} \\text{ for all } f \\in \\mathcal{F} \\text{ and } p \\in \\mathcal{P}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This definition is quite vague for practical application, so we are more interested in **natural** conjugates, whereby the conjugacy is specific to a particular distribution, and not just a class of distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the binomial model with a beta prior, we can now analytically calculate the posterior mean and variance for the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E[\\theta|n,y] = \\frac{\\alpha + y}{\\alpha + \\beta + n}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{eqnarray}\n",
    "\\text{Var}[\\theta|n,y] &=& \\frac{(\\alpha + y)(\\beta + n - y)}{(\\alpha + \\beta + n)^2(\\alpha + \\beta + n +1)} \\\\\n",
    "&=& \\frac{E[\\theta|n,y] (1-E[\\theta|n,y])}{\\alpha + \\beta + n +1}\n",
    "\\end{eqnarray}$$\n",

    "## Sampling Importance Resampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance sampling method can be modified to incorporate weighted bootstrapping, in a procedure called sampling importance resampling (SIR). As previously, we obtain a sample of size $M$ from an importance sampling distribution $q$ and calculate the corresponding weights $w(\\theta_i) = p(\\theta|y) / q(\\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of directly re-weighting the samples from $q$, SIR instead transforms the weights into probabilities via:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p_i = \\frac{w(\\theta_i)}{\\sum_{i=1}^M w(\\theta_i)}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These probabilities are then used to re-sample their respective $\\theta_i$ values, with replacement. This implies that the resulting resamples $\\theta_i^{\\prime}$ will be distributed approximately as the posterior $p(\\theta|y)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using again the beta-binomial example, we can take the weights calculated above, and convert them to probabilities:"
