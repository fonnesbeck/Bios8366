Hence, you know a variable is a subclass of `Factor` whenever it has a `logp` method, as we saw in the previous section.\n",

Also, we passed the value to be evaluated by the `logp` function as a **dictionary**, rather than as a plain integer.

Points in parameter space are represented by dictionaries with parameter names as they keys and the value of the parameters as the values.\n",

This function may employ other random variables in its calculation. \n",

As an example, fields like psychology and astrophysics have complex likelihood functions for a particular process that may require numerical approximation. In these cases, it is impossible to write the function in terms of predefined theano operators and we must use a custom theano operator using `as_op` or inheriting from `theano.Op`. \n",
