    "\n",
    "Python is slower than compiled languages for a variety of reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is Dynamically Typed rather than Statically Typed.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this means is that at the time the program executes, the interpreter doesn't know the type of the variables that are defined. For example, the difference between a C variable and a Python variable is summarized by this diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://jakevdp.github.io/images/cint_vs_pyint.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For a variable in C, the compiler knows the type by its very definition. For a variable in Python, all you know at the time the program executes is that it's some sort of Python object.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you write the following in C:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "int a = 1;\n",
    "int b = 2;\n",
    "int c = a + b;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the C compiler knows from the start that a and b are integers: they simply can't be anything else! With this knowledge, it can call the routine which adds two integers, returning another integer which is just a simple value in memory. As a rough schematic, the sequence of events looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**C Addition**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign <int> 1 to a\n",
    "2. Assign <int> 2 to b\n",
    "3. call binary_add<int, int>(a, b)\n",
    "4. Assign the result to c\n",
    "\n",
    "The equivalent code in Python looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "a = 1\n",
    "b = 2\n",
    "c = a + b\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "here the interpreter knows only that 1 and 2 are objects, but not what type of object they are. So the The interpreter must inspect PyObject_HEAD for each variable to find the type information, and then call the appropriate summation routine for the two types. Finally it must create and initialize a new Python object to hold the return value. The sequence of events looks roughly like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python Addition**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assign 1 to a\n",
    "    - Set a->PyObject_HEAD->typecode to integer\n",
    "    - Set a->val = 1\n",
    "2. Assign 2 to b\n",
    "    - Set b->PyObject_HEAD->typecode to integer\n",
    "    - Set b->val = 2\n",
    "3. call binary_add(a, b)\n",
    "    - find typecode in a->PyObject_HEAD\n",
    "    - a is an integer; value is a->val\n",
    "    - find typecode in b->PyObject_HEAD\n",
    "    - b is an integer; value is b->val\n",
    "    - call binary_add<int, int>(a->val, b->val)\n",
    "    - result of this is result, and is an integer.\n",
    "4. Create a Python object c\n",
    "    - set c->PyObject_HEAD->typecode to integer\n",
    "    - set c->val to result\n",
    "\n",
    "The dynamic typing means that there are a lot more steps involved with any operation. This is a primary reason that Python is slow compared to C for operations on numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python is interpreted rather than compiled.\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw above one difference between interpreted and compiled code. A smart compiler can look ahead and optimize for repeated or unneeded operations, which can result in speed-ups. Compiler optimization is its own beast, and I'm personally not qualified to say much about it, so I'll stop there. For some examples of this in action, you can take a look at my previous post on Numba and Cython.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python's object model can lead to inefficient memory access\n",
    "\n",
    "We saw above the extra type info layer when moving from a C integer to a Python integer. Now imagine you have many such integers and want to do some sort of batch operation on them. In Python you might use the standard List object, while in C you would likely use some sort of buffer-based array.\n",
    "\n",
    "A NumPy array in its simplest form is a Python object build around a C array. That is, it has a pointer to a contiguous data buffer of values. A Python list, on the other hand, has a pointer to a contiguous buffer of pointers, each of which points to a Python object which in turn has references to its data (in this case, integers). This is a schematic of what the two might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://jakevdp.github.io/images/array_vs_list.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easy to see that if you're doing some operation which steps through data in sequence, the numpy layout will be much more efficient than the Python layout, both in the cost of storage and the cost of access."

    "\n",
    "[`numexpr`](http://code.google.com/p/numexpr/) allows array expressions to be evaluated far faster that what can be achieved in Python using Numpy arrays. `numexpr` parses a string expression and optimizes and compiles the code on the fly, using a virtual machine that includes a [Just-in-time (JIT) compiler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation). In addition, `numexpr` offers direct support for parallel multi-threaded computations, since Python's global interpreter lock is bypassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python's global interpreter lock (GIL) ensures that only one thread runs in the interpreter at once. This simplifies many of the low-level activities, such as memory management, and allows for co-operative multi-tasking. But, since the currently-running thread holds onto the interpreter, it makes multi-core parallelization difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part the reason Python can be slow for array calculations is that it creates temporary arrays to store intermediate results from array element calculations, which wastes memory and cache. `numexpr` handles such calculations in manageable chunks, which accellerates computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The speedup over NumPy by using `numexpr` can be as high as 20x, but is typically in the range of 2-4x.\n",

When we set `wraparound` to False, Cython will not support negative indexes, as is the case with Python.
