    "# Introduction to PyMC3\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming (PP) allows flexible specification of Bayesian statistical models in code. PyMC3 is a new, open-source PP framework with an intuitive and readable, yet powerful, syntax that is close to the natural syntax statisticians use to describe models. It features next-generation Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms such as the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS; Hoffman, 2014), a self-tuning variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC; Duane, 1987). This class of samplers works well on high dimensional and complex posterior distributions and allows many complex models to be fit without specialized knowledge about fitting algorithms. HMC and NUTS take advantage of gradient information from the likelihood to achieve much faster convergence than traditional sampling methods, especially for larger models. NUTS also has several self-tuning strategies for adaptively setting the tunable parameters of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, which means you usually don't need to have specialized knowledge about how the algorithms work. PyMC3, Stan (Stan Development Team, 2014), and the LaplacesDemon package for R are currently the only PP packages to offer HMC.\n",

    "### PyMC3 Features\n",
    "\n",
    "Probabilistic programming in Python confers a number of advantages including multi-platform compatibility, an expressive yet clean and readable syntax, easy integration with other scientific libraries, and extensibility via C, C++, Fortran or Cython. These features make it relatively straightforward to write and use custom statistical distributions, samplers and transformation functions, as required by Bayesian analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyMC3's feature set helps to make Bayesian analysis as painless as possible. Here is a short list of some of its features:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Fits Bayesian statistical models with Markov chain Monte Carlo, variational inference and\n",
    "    other algorithms.\n",
    "-   Includes a large suite of well-documented statistical distributions.\n",
    "-   Creates summaries including tables and plots.\n",
    "-   Traces can be saved to the disk as plain text, SQLite or pandas dataframes.\n",
    "-   Several convergence diagnostics and model checking methods are available.\n",
    "-   Extensible: easily incorporates custom step methods and unusual probability distributions.\n",
    "-   MCMC loops can be embedded in larger programs, and results can be analyzed with the full power of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we present a primer on the use of PyMC3 for solving general Bayesian statistical inference and prediction problems. We will first see the basics of how to use PyMC3, motivated by a simple example: installation, data creation, model definition, model fitting and posterior analysis. Then we will cover two case studies and use them to show how to define and fit more sophisticated models. Finally we will show how to extend PyMC3 and discuss other useful features: the Generalized Linear Models subpackage, custom distributions, custom transformations and alternative storage backends."

The key characteristic of the context manager is that the resources it manages are only defined within the indented block corresponding to the `with` statement.

The reason is simple: to use Bayes' theorem to compute the posterior, we require the likelihood. Even though `disasters`'s value is known and fixed, we need to formally assign it a *probability distribution* as if it were a random variable. Remember, the likelihood and the probability function are essentially the same, except that the former is regarded as a function of the parameters and the latter as a function of the data. This point can be counterintuitive at first, as many peoples' instinct is to regard data as fixed a priori and unknown variables as dependent on the data. \n",
