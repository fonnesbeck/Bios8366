But most scientists start working alone with a few files or with a small team, so I feel it's important to build first the key concepts and practices based on problems scientists encounter in their everyday life and without the jargon of the software world.  Once you've become familiar with 1-4, the excellent tutorials that exist about collaborating on github on open-source projects should make sense."
