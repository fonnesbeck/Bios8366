    "\n",
    "As an example of implementing Dirichlet processes for random effects, we will use the radon measurement and remediation example from [Gelman and Hill (2006)](http://amzn.to/gFfJbs). This problem uses measurements of [radon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radon) (a carcinogenic, radioactive gas) from households in 85 counties in Minnesota to estimate the distribution of the substance across the state. This dataset has a natural hierarchical structure, with individual measurements nested within households, and households in turn nested within counties. Here, we are certainly interested in modeling the variation in counties, but do not have covariates measured at that level. Since we are more interested in the variation among counties, rather than the particular levels for each, a random effects model is appropriate. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the original example from Gelman and Hill, measurements are modeled as being normally distributed, with a mean that is a hierarchical function of both a county-level random effect and a fixed effect that accounted for whether houses had a basement (this is thought to increase radon levels).\n",

    "This comprises a so-called \"partial pooling\" model, whereby counties are neither constrained to have identical means (full pooling) nor are assumed to have completely independent means (no pooling); in most applications, the truth is somewhere between these two extremes. Though this is a very flexible approach to accounting for county-level variance, one might be worried about imposing such a restrictive (thin-tailed) distribution like the normal on this variance. If there are counties that have extremely low or high levels (for whatever reason), this model will fit poorly. To allay such worries, we can hedge our bets by selecting a more forgiving functional form, such as [Student's t](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student's_t-distribution) or [Cauchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution), but these still impose parametric restrictions (*e.g.* symmetry about the mean) that we may be uncomfortable making. So, in the interest of even greater flexibility, we will replace the normal county random effect with a non-parametric alternative, using a Dirichlet process.\n",
