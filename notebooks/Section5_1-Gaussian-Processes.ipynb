    "Use of the term \"non-parametric\" in the context of Bayesian analysis is something of a misnomer. This is because the first and fundamental step in Bayesian modeling is to specify a *full probability model* for the problem at hand. It is rather difficult to explicitly state a full probability model without the use of probability functions, which are parametric. Bayesian non-parametric methods do not imply that there are no parameters, but rather that the number of parameters grows with the size of the dataset. In fact, Bayesian non-parametric models are *infinitely* parametric."

When we write a function that takes continuous values as inputs, we are essentially specifying an infinte vector that only returns values (indexed by the inputs) when the function is called upon to do so.

    "## Faster Gaussian processes\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the major constraints that limits the utility of Gaussian processes in practice is the inversion of $K$ when calculating the posterior covariance. Since it is evaluated at every observed data point, its execution time is $\\mathcal{O(n^3)}$, which makes Gaussian processes (in the form I have presented here) impractical for larger datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "An approach for dealing with this computation complexity is to look for an approximation to accelerate training and prediction. For Gaussian processes, this can be accomplished by employing a **sparse approximation** to the Gram matrix that places $M<<N$ *inducing points* along the range of the input variables, and uses this to estimate the full covariance matrix for the observed points. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `gp.MarginalSparse` class implements sparse, or inducing point, GP approximations.  It works identically to `gp.Marginal`, except it additionally requires the locations of the inducing points (denoted `Xu`), and it accepts the argument `sigma` instead of `noise` because these sparse approximations assume white IID noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "The downside of sparse approximations is that they reduce the expressiveness of the GP.  Reducing the dimension of the covariance matrix effectively reduces the number of covariance matrix eigenvectors that can be used to fit the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A choice that needs to be made is where to place the inducing points.  One option is to use a subset of the inputs.  Another possibility is to use K-means.  The location of the inducing points can also be an unknown and optimized as part of the model.  These sparse approximations are useful for speeding up calculations when the density of data points is high and the lengthscales is larger than the separations between inducing points. "
