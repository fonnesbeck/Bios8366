    "# Parallel Processing in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "An obvious way to improve the performance of Python code is to make it run in parallel. Any relatively new computer will have multiple cores, which means that several processors can operate on the same data stored on memory. However, most of the code we have written in the course so far does not take advantage of more than one of them. In addition there is now widespread availability of computing clusters, such as [those offered for use by Amazon](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) (Vanderbilt also has [its own cluster](http://www.accre.vanderbilt.edu)). Clusters allow several computers to work together by exchanging data over a network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallel computing involves breaking a task into several independent sub-tasks, distributing these sub-tasks to available processors or computers, then coordinating the execution of these tasks and combining their outputs in an appropriate way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several different models for parallel processing, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Message passing**: processes or other program components running in parallel communicate by sending and receiving messages, which allows for easy synchronization. \n",
    "* **Multi-threading**: within a single process, some architectures allow for the existence of several \"threads\", which execute independently, though they share the memory and state of the process in which they reside. Multi-threading is good for increasing *throughput* and reducing *latency*.\n",
    "* **Task farming**: a master process delegates independent calculations to available processors (task farm), and collects their outputs when complete.\n",
    "* **Single program, multiple data (SPMD)** Probably the most common type of parallel processing, in which tasks are split up and run simultaneously on multiple processors with different input in order to obtain results faster. All tasks execute their copy of the same program simultaneously.\n",
    "* **Multiple program, multiple data (MPMD)** Like SPMD, except each task may be executing a different program."
