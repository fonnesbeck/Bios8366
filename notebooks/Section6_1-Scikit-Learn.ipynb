    "# Introduction to `Scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scikit-learn` package is an open-source library that provides a robust set of machine learning algorithms for Python. It is built upon the core Python scientific stack (*i.e.* NumPy, SciPy, Cython), and has a simple, consistent API, making it useful for a wide range of statistical learning applications.\n",

    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is about coding programs that automatically adjust their performance from exposure to information encoded in data. This learning is achieved via **tunable parameters** that are automatically adjusted according to performance criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning can be considered a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three major classes of ML:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms which learn from a training set of *labeled* examples (exemplars) to generalize to the set of all possible inputs. Examples of supervised learning include regression and support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms which learn from a training set of *unlableled* examples, using the features of the inputs to categorize inputs together according to some statistical criteria. Examples of unsupervised learning include k-means clustering and kernel density estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning**\n",
    ": Algorithms that learn via reinforcement from a *critic* that provides information on the quality of a solution, but not on how to improve it. Improved solutions are achieved by iteratively exploring the solution space. We will not cover RL in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Representing Data in `scikit-learn`\n",
    "\n",
    "Most machine learning algorithms implemented in scikit-learn expect data to be stored in a\n",
    "**two-dimensional array or matrix**.  The arrays can be\n",
    "either ``numpy`` arrays, or in some cases ``scipy.sparse`` matrices.\n",
    "The size of the array is expected to be `[n_samples, n_features]`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **n_samples:**   The number of samples: each sample is an item to process (e.g. classify).\n",
    "  A sample can be a document, a picture, a sound, a video, an astronomical object,\n",
    "  a row in database or CSV file,\n",
    "  or whatever you can describe with a fixed set of quantitative traits.\n",
    "- **n_features:**  The number of features or distinct traits that can be used to describe each\n",
    "  item in a quantitative manner.  Features are generally real-valued, but may be boolean or\n",
    "  discrete-valued in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of features must be fixed in advance. However it can be very high dimensional\n",
    "(e.g. millions of features) with most of them being zeros for a given sample. This is a case\n",
    "where `scipy.sparse` matrices can be useful, in that they are\n",
    "much more memory-efficient than numpy arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example: Iris morphometrics\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the datasets included with `scikit-learn` is a set of measurements for flowers, each being a member of one of three species: *Iris Setosa*, *Iris Versicolor* or *Iris Virginica*. \n",

For example, we might want 2 variables so that we can visualize differences among the species graphically.\n",

It then identifies a third such orthogonal vector, and so on, up to the number of original variables in the dataset.\n",
