    "\n",
    "Another effective ensemble method for classification and regression is gradient boosting, or **boosting**. Boosting was originally derived in the computational learning theory literature, where it was proved that one could boost the performance of any \"weak\" learner arbitrarily high, provided the weak learner could always perform slightly better than chance. The idea is that by sequentially applying very fast, simple models, we can get a total model error which is better than any of the individual pieces. Hastie and Tibshirani describe it as:\n",

    "One of the simplest and most prevalent boosting algorithms is the **AdaBoost.M1** method by [Freund and Schapire (1997)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002200009791504X), which aims to improve the accuracy of *any* learning algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we consider a binary output, coded as $Y \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. We can define the error rate of some classifier $G(X)$ as:\n",

    "$$\\overline{err} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N I[y_i \\ne G(x_i)]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A classifier is called a *weak* classifier when its error rate is only marginally better than random selection of outcomes. Boosting takes a weak classifier and applies it sequentially to data which have been weighted by having been passed through previous iterations of the classifier. A final prediction is produced by a weighted majority vote from all the classifiers.\n",
    "\n",
    "![adaboost](http://d.pr/i/1bTsQ+)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, the $\\alpha_m$ values are calculated by the classifier, and are used to weight the estimates in generating a final prediction. Observations that are misclassified by a given classifier are weighted more heavily so that they are given more emphasis in subsequent classification steps. Hence, observations that are more troublesome are given increasing influence, until they are classified correctly.\n",

For example, if you want to capture the interaction between a feature ``latitude`` and a feature ``longitude`` your trees need a depth of at least two to capture this. Unfortunately, the degree of feature interactions is not known in advance but it is usually fine to assume that it is faily low; in practice, a depth of 4-6 usually gives the best results. In scikit-learn you can constrain the depth of the trees using the ``max_depth`` argument.\n",

    "Another way to control the depth of the trees is by enforcing a lower bound on the number of samples in a leaf. This will avoid inbalanced splits where a leaf is formed for just one extreme data point. In scikit-learn you can do this using the argument ``min_samples_leaf``. This is effectively a means to introduce bias into your model with the hope to also reduce variance as shown in the example below:"
