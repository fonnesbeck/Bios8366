    "Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. Theano features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __tight integration with numpy__ – Use numpy.ndarray in Theano-compiled functions.\n",
    "* __transparent use of a GPU__ – Perform data-intensive calculations up to 140x faster than with CPU.(float32 only)\n",
    "* __efficient symbolic differentiation__ – Theano does your derivatives for function with one or many inputs.\n",
    "* __speed and stability optimizations__ – Get the right answer for log(1+x) even when x is really tiny.\n",
    "* __dynamic C code generation__ – Evaluate expressions faster.\n",
    "* __extensive unit-testing and self-verification__ – Detect and diagnose errors.\n",
