    "# Markov chain Monte Carlo\n",
    "\n",
    "A major takeaway from the previous section is the inherent difficulty in calculating or estimating posterior distributions for use in Bayesian inference. The two alternative strategies to obtaining posteriors for moderate to large models involve either analytic **approximations** or stochastic **sampling**. Approximations are usually valid conditional on assumptions regarding the true posterior distribution, which are typically impossible to validate. Direct sampling strategies rely on our ability to sample from the posterior distribution, and this is frequently not possible. Indirect sampling methods, such as rejection sampling, can be plagued with sampling efficiency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sampling approaches we have introduced so far have each attempted to obtain *independent* samples from the posterior distribution. It turns out, however, that it is possible to generate samples from the posterior distribution using a *dependent* sampling algorithm, and despite the dependence of the samples, one may extract valid inference from them. A class of algorithms called **Markov chain Monte Carlo** yields a Markovian sample (explained below) which, provided that certain conditions are satisfied, is guaranteed to be indistinguishable from a sample drawn from the true posterior itself."

    "## Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov chain is a special type of *stochastic process*. The standard definition of a stochastic process is an ordered collection of random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "\\begin{split}\\{X_t:t \\in T\\}\\end{split}\\notag\\\\\\begin{split}\\end{split}\\notag\n",
    "\\end{gathered}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $t$ is frequently (but not necessarily) a time index. If we think of $X_t$ as a state $X$ at time $t$, and invoke the following dependence condition on each state:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{gathered}\n",
    "\\begin{split}Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t, X_{t-1}=x_{t-1},\\ldots,X_0=x_0) = Pr(X_{t+1}=x_{t+1} | X_t=x_t)\\end{split}\\notag\\\\\\begin{split}\\end{split}\\notag\\end{gathered}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "then the stochastic process is known as a Markov chain. This conditioning specifies that the future depends on the current state, but not past states. Thus, the Markov chain wanders about the state space,\n",
    "remembering only where it has just been in the last time step. The collection of transition probabilities is sometimes called a *transition matrix* when dealing with discrete states, or more generally, a\n",
    "*transition kernel*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of Markov chain Monte Carlo, it is useful to think of the Markovian property as “mild non-independence”. MCMC allows us to indirectly generate independent samples from a particular posterior distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markov Chain Jargon\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we move on, it is important to define some general properties of Markov chains. They are frequently encountered in the MCMC literature, and some will help us decide whether MCMC is producing a useful sample from the posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Homogeneity**: A Markov chain is homogeneous at step $t$ if the transition probabilities are independent of time $t$. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Irreducibility** A Markov chain is irreducible if every state is accessible in one or more steps from any other state. That is, the chain contains no absorbing states. This implies that there is a non-zero probability of eventually reaching state $k$ from any other state in the chain. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Recurrence** States which are visited repeatedly are *recurrent*. If the expected time to return to a particular state is bounded, this is known as *positive recurrence*, otherwise the recurrent state is *null recurrent*. Further, a chain is *Harris recurrent* when it visits all states $X \\in S$ infinitely often in the limit as $t \\to \\infty$; this is an important characteristic when dealing with unbounded, continuous state spaces. Whenever a chain ends up in a closed, irreducible set of Harris recurrent states, it stays there forever and visits every state with probability one. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Stationarity** A stationary Markov chain produces the same marginal distribution when multiplied by the transition kernel. Thus, if $P$ is some $n \\times n$ transition matrix: \n",
    " \n",
    "$${\\bf \\pi P} = {\\bf \\pi}$$\n",
    "    \n",
    "for Markov chain $\\pi$. Thus, $\\pi$ is no longer subscripted, and is referred to as the *limiting distribution* of the chain. In MCMC, the chain explores the state space according to its limiting marginal distribution. \n",
    " \n",
    "**Ergodicity**: Ergodicity is an emergent property of Markov chains which are irreducible, positive Harris recurrent and aperiodic. Ergodicity is defined as: \n",
    " \n",
    "$$\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} Pr^{(n)}(\\theta_i \\rightarrow \\theta_j) = \\pi(\\theta) \\quad \\forall \\theta_i, \\theta_j \\in \\Theta$$  \n",
    "    \n",
    "or in words, after many steps the marginal distribution of the chain is the \n",
    "same at one step as at all other steps. This implies that our Markov chain, \n",
    "which we recall is dependent, can generate samples that are independent if \n",
    "we wait long enough between samples. If it means anything to you, \n",
    "ergodicity is the analogue of the strong law of large numbers for Markov \n",
    "chains. For example, take values $\\theta_{i+1},\\ldots,\\theta_{i+n}$\n",
    "from a chain that has reached an ergodic state. A statistic of interest can \n",
    "then be estimated by:\n",
    " \n",

    "${\\bf \\theta}$. In fact, the algorithm cannot be implemented without them. Of course, the posterior conditionals cannot always be neatly specified. In contrast to the Gibbs algorithm, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm generates candidate state transitions from an alternate distribution, and accepts or rejects each candidate probabilistically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first consider a simple Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for a single parameter, $\\theta$. We will use a standard sampling distribution, referred to as the **proposal distribution**, to produce candidate variables $q_t(\\theta^{\\prime} | \\theta)$. That is, the generated value, $\\theta^{\\prime}$, is a *possible* next value for\n",
    "$\\theta$ at step $t+1$. We also need to be able to calculate the probability of moving back to the original value from the candidate, or $q_t(\\theta | \\theta^{\\prime})$. These probabilistic ingredients are used to define an **acceptance ratio**:\n",

    "## Slice Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "Though Gibbs sampling is very computationally efficient, it can be difficult to implement in a general way, whereas the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is relatively inefficient, while being easy to implement for a variety of models. We have seen that it is possible to tune Metropolis samplers, but it would be nice to have a \"black-box\" method that works for arbitrary continuous distributions, which we may know little about *a priori*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***slice sampler*** bridges this gap by being both efficient and easy to program generally.\n",
    "The idea is to first sample from the conditional distribution for $y$ given some current value of $x$, which is uniform over the $(0, f (x))$, and conditional on this value for $y$, then sample $x$, which is uniform on $S = {x : y < f (x)},$, that is the “slice” defined by the $y$ value. Hence, this algorithm automatically adapts to the local characteristics of the posterior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps required to perform a single iteration of the slice sampler to update the current value of $x_i$ is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sample $y$ uniformly on $(0,f(x_i))$. \n",
    "2. Use this value $y$ to define a horizontal *slice* $S = \\{x : y < f (x)\\}$. \n",
    "3. Establish an interval, $I = (x_{a}, x_{b})$, around $x_i$ that contains most of the slice.\n",
    "4. Sample $x_{i+1}$ from the region of the slice overlaping $I$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, slice sampling employs an **auxilliary variable** ($y$) that is not retained at the end of the iteration. Note that in practice one may operate on the log scale such that $g(x) = \\log(f (x))$ to avoid floating-point underflow. In this case, the auxiliary variable becomes $z = log(y) = g(x_i) − e$, where $e \\sim \\text{Exp}(1)$, resulting in the slice $S = \\{x : z < g(x)\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways of establishing and sampling from the interval $I$, with the only restriction being that the resulting Markov chain leaves $f(x)$ *invariant*. The objective is to include as much of the slice as possible, so that the potential step size can be large, but not (much) larger than the slice, so that the sampling of invalid points is minimized. Ideally, we would like it to be the slice itself, but it may not always be feasible to determine (and certainly not automatically).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stepping out\n",
    "\n",
    "One method for determining a sampling interval for $x_{i+1}$  involves specifying an initial \"guess\" at the slice width $w$, and iteratively moving the endpoints out (growing the interval) until either (1) the interval reaches a maximum pre-speficied width or (2) $y$ is less than the $f(x)$ evaluated both at the left and the right interval endpoints."
